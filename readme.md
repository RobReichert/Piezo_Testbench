# Description 
This repository contains the software for a test bench setup for measuring piezo actuators based on the Redpitaya development board. The software is divided into 3 parts:
1. The FPGA code created in the vivado block design can be found in the folder ==Vivado==
2. The server software which runs on the integrated microprocessor can be found in the folder ==Onboard==
3. The Python based user interface which retrieves the data from the server and configures the test bench can be found in the folder ==PC_Client==

Each folder contains its own readme.md file describing how to work with the software.
